<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I’m driven by movement, challenge, and precision.
   I come from a downhill mountain biking background, 
   riding flow trails, light technical lines, and urban features 
   like stairs and small jumps. I don’t just ride—I build, tune,
    and maintain my own bike, which taught me control, awareness, 
    and respect for every detail.</p>

    <p>To balance power with endurance,
       I run regularly during the week and ride on weekends. 
       Running sharpened my discipline and mental stamina,
        while biking trained my reflexes and confidence under pressure.
       Together, they built both my body and mindset.</p>


      <p>I also have experience in airsoft, where teamwork, strategy, 
        and mechanical understanding matter as much as physical ability.
         Airsoft taught me patience, situational 
         awareness, and responsibility—skills
         that carry over to both sports and everyday challenges.</p>
