I enjoy learning technology through hands-on projects such as simple
programming tasks, ESP32 projects, and experimenting with sensors and displays.

I have an interest in airsoft equipment, especially understanding how the
mechanical parts work. I do basic checking and repair, which improves my
attention to detail and problem-solving skills.
